<h3>Top 3 cars of all times</h3>                                    
1)..<B>Benz Motorwagen</B><br>
   created in 1886 and powered by an internal combustinon engine,the Motorwagen was essentially the world's first motor car(previous automobile were powered by steam or electricity).Only 25 units were built<Img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/15Vl8Xi90AA/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLBtSFZC9eTJqDh_DV9GZIxH9LBKTQ"align=right height="200" width="300",and the four-stroke engine that powered the early models produced less than <B>one horse power</B>.Despite its meager speeds,the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today.The first Motorwagen used the Benz 954 cc (58.2 cu in) single-cylinder four-stroke engine with trembler coil ignition.[16] This new engine produced 500 watts (2‚ÅÑ3 hp) at 250 rpm in the Patent-Motorwagen, although later tests by the University of Mannheim showed it to be capable of 670 W (0.9 hp) at 400 rpm. It was an extremely light engine for the time, weighing about 100 kg (220 lb). Although its open crankcase and drip oiling system would be alien to a modern mechanic, its use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust would be quite familiar. A large horizontal flywheel stabilized the single-cylinder engine's power output. An evaporative carburettor was controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed.

2)..<B>Pope-Waverly</B><BR>
    Pope-Waverley was one of the marques of the Pope Motor Car Company founded by Albert Augustus Pope and was a manufacturer of Brass Era electric automobiles in Indianapolis, Indiana. From 1908 until production ceased in 1914 they became independent again as the Waverley Company.<Img src="https://hymanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6291.jpg"align=right height="200" width="300">The company was originally formed as the Indiana Bicycle Company in 1898, changing to the American Bicycle Company in 1900. In 1901, it became the International Motor Car Company, before joining the Pope group as the Waverley Department of Pope Motor Car Company in 1904. Originally a small runabout, the Waverley grew to include 4 seats by 1902. When the Pope empire was foundering in 1908, Indianapolis businessmen rescued the Pope-Waverley and established a new Waverley Company to continue production. From 1912, the Waverley had a hood to resemble a gasoline car. This was called the Sheltered Roaster but it later became the Model 90. Front Drive and Rear Drive model designations were used based on the drivers seating position.The company was originally formed as the Indiana Bicycle Company in 1898, changing to the American Bicycle Company in 1900.
